      The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated one-toed hoofed
      mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two
      extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45
      to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the
      large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses
      around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been
      widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated,
      although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.
      These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to
      describe horses that have never been domesticated. There is an extensive,
      specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering
      everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds,
      locomotion, and behavior. Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to
      quickly escape predators, possessing an excellent sense of balance and a
      strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from
      predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both
      standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep
      significantly more than adults.[4] Female horses, called mares, carry
      their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal,
      can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin
      training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four.
      They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average
      lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely divided into
      three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with
      speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies,
      suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses
      between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for
      specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300
      breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.
      Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and
      non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities
      such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were
      historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and
      driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and
      methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat,
      milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of
      pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and
      shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and
      farriers.

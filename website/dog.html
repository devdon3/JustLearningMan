      The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus
      familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is
      characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient,
      extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living
      relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by
      hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of
      agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have
      expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the
      ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
      canids.[11] Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human
      behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent
      study.[12] The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various
      behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[13] Dog breeds
      vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans,
      such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and
      the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This
      influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best
      friend.Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally
      recognized dog breeds.[10] In the Victorian era, directed human selection
      developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of
      phenotypes.[8] Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders
      within the last 200 years,[8][10] and since then dogs have undergone rapid
      phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to
      artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull, body, and limb
      proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more
      phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of
      carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology,
      which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and
      colour.[8] Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and
      hunting,[8] retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits
      include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression,[10] which
      demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.[8] As a
      result, today dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are
      dispersed around the world.[10] The most striking example of this
      dispersal is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during
      the Victorian era.

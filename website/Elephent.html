      Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are
      currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest
      elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an informal grouping within the
      proboscidean family Elephantidae. Elephantidae is the only surviving
      family of proboscideans; extinct members include the mastodons.
      Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths
      and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have larger ears and
      concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or
      level backs. The distinctive features of all elephants include a long
      proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough
      but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and
      water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from
      the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects
      and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body
      temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their
      great weight.Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South
      Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including
      savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they
      stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone
      species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a
      fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to
      socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist
      of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring.
      The groups, which do not include bulls, are usually led by the oldest cow,
      known as the matriarch. Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they
      reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly
      interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of
      increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them
      gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success. Calves
      are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their
      mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in
      the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants
      use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant
      intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They
      appear to have self-awareness, and appear to show empathy for dying and
      dead family members. African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed
      as endangered and African forest elephants as critically endangered by the
      International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest
      threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are
      poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include
      habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as
      working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they
      are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for
      entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been
      featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.
